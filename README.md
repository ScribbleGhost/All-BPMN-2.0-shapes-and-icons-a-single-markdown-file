# All BPMN 2.0 shapes and icons a single markdown file

Not much else to say.

The shapes and structure of the file is a near-perfect copy of https://cloud.trisotech.com/bpmnquickguide. However this file has all shapes and symbols in one file.

This might be handy if you are learning BPMN 2 and want to make some notes, but don't care to recreate the entire structure. Just download this and edit the document however you want.
